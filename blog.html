                            The internet we use every day is built for us,
                            humans. It’s full of colorful buttons, easy-to-read
                            text, and videos. But a new kind of user is here:
                            Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is getting smarter
                            and doing more for us. The problem is, the internet
                            we have now isn't very friendly for AI. It's like
                            asking a super-smart robot to read a fancy,
                            handwritten invitation – it can struggle.

                            internet, one built just for AI. Let's call our
                            current internet the "GUI-Web" (because it uses
                            Graphical User Interfaces, or visuals). The new one
                            will be the "AI-Web." It will exist alongside the
                            GUI-Web, like a parallel digital road built just for
                            AI traffic.

                                It started as a way for scientists and the
                                military to share information. It was all about
                                sending data reliably, not about being pretty or
                                easy to use for everyday people. Think of it
                                like the basic plumbing. (Key developments:
                                ARPANET launched in
                                <strong>1969</strong>; TCP/IP standardized in
                                the <strong>1970s</strong>, adopted by ARPANET
                                in <strong>1983</strong>).

                                Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web
                                around <strong>1989-1991</strong>. This gave us
                                websites and links, making it easier to find and
                                share information. At this point, it was mostly
                                text.

                                Interfaces (GUIs) came along. Suddenly, you
                                could click on pictures and menus instead of
                                typing commands. Browsers like Mosaic (released
                                <strong>1993</strong>) and Netscape (released
                                <strong>1994</strong>) made the internet
                                colorful and much easier for everyone to use.

                            writing, answer questions, and even manage tasks.
                            But these smart AI systems are trying to use an
                            internet that wasn't designed for them.

                            has to "scrape" or pick through these visual designs
                            to find information. This is slow, clumsy, and can
                            easily break if a website changes its look. Imagine
                            trying to understand a book by only looking at its
                            fancy cover art – that's kind of what AI faces. The
